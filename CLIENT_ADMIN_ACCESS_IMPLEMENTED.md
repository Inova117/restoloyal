# Client Admin Access Implementation

## Problem Solved
User with `client_admin` role in metadata was being defaulted to `location_staff` instead of accessing Tier 2 (Client Dashboard).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Role Detection
- Added fallback check for `user.user_metadata.role === 'client_admin'`
- Added `force_client_admin` session storage flag for manual access
- Added comprehensive debugging logs

### 2. Client Dashboard Access Button
- Added "Client Dashboard" button in location staff header
- Only visible for users with `client_admin` role in metadata
- Uses Crown icon to indicate elevated access
- Sets `force_client_admin` flag and reloads page

### 3. Return to Staff View
- Added "Back to Staff View" button in GallettiHQDashboard header
- Only visible for client admin users
- Clears `force_client_admin` flag and returns to staff interface

### 4. Session Management
- `force_client_admin` flag is cleared on platform return
- Proper cleanup in `returnToPlatform()` function

## User Flow

### For Client Admin Users:
1. **Default View**: Location Staff interface (Tier 4)
2. **Access Tier 2**: Click "Client Dashboard" button → Switches to GallettiHQDashboard
3. **Return to Staff**: Click "Back to Staff View" → Returns to location staff interface

### Role Detection Priority:
1. Force client admin flag (manual override)
2. ZerionCore admin emails
3. Admin context (super admin viewing client)
4. Location context (HQ viewing location)
5. Galletti HQ emails
6. Restaurant ownership check
7. User roles table query
8. **User metadata fallback** ← NEW
9. Default to location staff

## Files Modified:
- `src/hooks/useUserRole.ts` - Enhanced role detection
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Added client dashboard access button
- `src/components/GallettiHQDashboard.tsx` - Added return button

## Testing:
User with metadata:
```json
{
  "role": "client_admin",
  "client_id": "9be8bc0f-1fa4-42ae-b5b6-17d09284c060",
  "full_name": "ZerionStudio Admin",
  "client_name": "ZerionStudio"
}
```

Should now be able to:
- ✅ See "Client Dashboard" button in staff view
- ✅ Access Tier 2 dashboard by clicking the button
- ✅ See "Back to Staff View" button in client dashboard
- ✅ Return to staff interface seamlessly
