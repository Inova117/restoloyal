## 🔄 **STEP 2: Current Mock Mode Status**

```
✅ READY TO TEST:
🟢 staff-manager      - Staff invitation and role management
🟢 customer-manager   - Customer CRUD operations and loyalty tracking
🟢 location-manager   - Location management and hierarchy

⏳ STILL MOCK MODE (for later):

## 🧪 **STEP 3: Test Your System** (10 minutes)

### **Test Customer Management:**
1. **Login to your app**
2. **Go to Customer Manager**
3. **Try creating a customer** → Should work with real API now!
4. **Try editing customer details** → Should save to database
5. **Check customer list** → Should show real data

### **Test Staff Management:**
1. **Go to Staff Manager**
2. **Try inviting a staff member** → Should create real user account
3. **Try assigning roles** → Should update database
4. **Check staff list** → Should show real data

### **Test Location Management:**
1. **Go to Location Manager**
2. **Try creating a location** → Should work with real API
3. **Check location hierarchy** → Should show proper relationships

---

## 🔍 **STEP 4: Verify Everything Works**

### **Check Mock Mode Status:**
```bash
node scripts/disable-mock-mode.cjs status
```

### **Check Database:**
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check that data is being created
SELECT 'customers' as table_name, count(*) as records FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'user_roles' as table_name, count(*) as records FROM user_roles
UNION ALL  
SELECT 'locations' as table_name, count(*) as records FROM locations;
```
