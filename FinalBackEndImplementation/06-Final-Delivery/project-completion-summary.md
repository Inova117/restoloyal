## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### 4-Tier Hierarchy System
```
Tier 1: SUPERADMIN (Platform Owner)
  └── Tier 2: CLIENT ADMIN (Restaurant Business HQ)
      └── Tier 3: LOCATION STAFF (Store Managers/POS Users)
          └── Tier 4: CUSTOMERS (End Users via QR/POS Only)
```

### Database Schema (10 Tables)
1. **superadmins** - Platform ownership and bootstrap control
2. **clients** - Restaurant businesses (unlimited tenants)
3. **client_admins** - Business administrators and management
4. **locations** - Restaurant locations and branches
5. **location_staff** - Store managers and POS operators
6. **customers** - End users and loyalty program participants (QR-code based, no auth accounts)
7. **stamps** - Loyalty points and transaction tracking
8. **rewards** - Reward redemptions and benefit management
9. **user_roles** - Central role tracking for authenticated users (tiers 1-3)
10. **hierarchy_audit_log** - Complete operation audit trail

**Note**: Customers use QR codes for identification and don't require authentication accounts, enabling seamless in-store loyalty experience.

### Security Framework
- **Database-Level Enforcement**: Foreign key constraints prevent hierarchy violations
- **Row-Level Security**: 40+ policies controlling all data access
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: `client_id` in all tables ensuring zero data leakage
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all user creation and operations
- **Zero Public Signup**: All users created through controlled APIs only

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Access Control Matrix
| Role | Create Clients | Create Locations | Create Staff | Create Customers | View Data Scope |
|------|---------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **SUPERADMIN** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Platform-wide |
| **CLIENT ADMIN** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Own business only |
| **LOCATION STAFF** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Own location only |
| **CUSTOMER** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Own data only |

### RLS Policy Coverage
- **SELECT Policies**: Read access control for all user types
- **INSERT Policies**: Creation permissions based on hierarchy level
- **UPDATE Policies**: Modification rights with ownership validation
- **DELETE Policies**: Deletion restrictions and cascade management
- **Cross-Table Validation**: Foreign key relationship enforcement via policies

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Automated Test Suite
- `run_complete_hierarchy_tests()` - Full system validation
