# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide - React SPA Routing Fix

## ✅ Problem Solved
The "Page not found" error on Netlify for React SPA routes has been fixed with proper redirect configuration.

## 📁 Files Created/Updated

### 1. `public/_redirects`
```
# Handle Supabase auth callbacks specifically
/auth/callback    /index.html   200
/auth/*           /index.html   200

# Handle all other client-side routes
/*                /index.html   200
```

### 2. `netlify.toml`
- Build configuration
- Security headers
- Performance optimizations
- Backup redirect rules

## 🔧 How It Works

### The Problem
- React Router handles routing client-side
- When users visit `/auth` directly or refresh the page, Netlify looks for a file at that path
- Since it's a SPA, the file doesn't exist → 404 error

### The Solution
- `_redirects` file tells Netlify to serve `index.html` for all routes
- React Router then takes over and handles the routing client-side
- Status code `200` (not `301/302`) preserves the URL in the browser

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Add Netlify redirects for React SPA routing"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Netlify Auto-Deploy
- Netlify will automatically detect the changes
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Netlify dashboard:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## 🧪 Testing Routes

After deployment, test these URLs directly:
- ✅ `https://restaurantloyalty.netlify.app/`
- ✅ `https://restaurantloyalty.netlify.app/auth`
- ✅ `https://restaurantloyalty.netlify.app/auth/callback`
- ✅ Any other client-side routes

## 🔒 Security Features Added

### Headers in `netlify.toml`:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer info

### Caching Strategy:
- Static assets: 1 year cache
- HTML files: No cache (always fresh)
- Service worker: No cache

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still getting 404s
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and try incognito mode

### Issue: Environment variables not working
**Solution:** Check Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution:** Check build logs in Netlify dashboard

### Issue: Supabase auth not working
**Solution:** Verify redirect URLs in Supabase dashboard match your Netlify domain

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### Build Optimizations:
- Vite automatically optimizes bundle size
- Tree shaking removes unused code
- Code splitting for better loading

### Netlify Features:
- CDN distribution
- Automatic HTTPS
- Branch previews for testing

## 🔄 Supabase Auth Configuration

Ensure these URLs are configured in Supabase:

### Site URL:
```
https://restaurantloyalty.netlify.app
```

### Redirect URLs:
```
https://restaurantloyalty.netlify.app/auth/callback
https://restaurantloyalty.netlify.app/auth/callback?*
https://restaurantloyalty.netlify.app/**
```
