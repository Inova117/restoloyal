---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES BREAKDOWN**

### **🔴 PRIORITY 1: POS Operations (CRITICAL)**
**Impact**: Staff cannot perform core business operations

#### Problems:
1. **pos-operations Edge Function** not deployed
2. **Customer lookup** returns mock data
3. **Stamp addition** doesn't persist to database
4. **Reward redemption** doesn't update customer records
5. **QR code scanning** simulated only

#### Solution:
```bash
# Deploy POS operations Edge Function
supabase functions deploy pos-operations
```

#### Test Verification:
- [ ] Real customer lookup by phone/email/QR
- [ ] Actual stamp addition with database persistence
- [ ] Real reward redemption with balance updates
- [ ] QR code generation and scanning

---

### **⚠️ PRIORITY 2: Client Management (HIGH)**
**Impact**: Platform admins cannot fully manage clients

#### Problems:
1. **create-client-with-user-v2** Edge Function not deployed
2. Client deletion fails silently
3. User role assignment partially broken

#### Solution:
```bash
# Deploy client management Edge Function  
supabase functions deploy create-client-with-user-v2
```

#### Test Verification:
- [ ] Create new client with admin user
- [ ] Delete existing client completely
- [ ] Recreate client with same name (slug conflict test)

---

### **⚠️ PRIORITY 3: Staff Management (HIGH)**
**Impact**: Client admins cannot manage staff properly

#### Problems:
1. **staff-manager** Edge Function not deployed
2. Staff invitations not sending
3. Role assignments incomplete

#### Solution:
```bash
# Deploy staff management Edge Function
supabase functions deploy staff-manager
```

---

### **🟡 PRIORITY 4: Environment Configuration (MEDIUM)**
**Impact**: Security vulnerability with hardcoded admin emails

#### Problems:
1. Admin emails hardcoded as fallback
2. Environment variables not configured in production
3. Inconsistent admin detection

#### Solution:
```bash
# Configure environment variables in Netlify
VITE_PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@zerioncore.com,platform@zerioncore.com
VITE_GALLETTI_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@galletti.com,corporate@galletti.com
```
