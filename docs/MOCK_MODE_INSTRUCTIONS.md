## Troubleshooting

### If you see "gin_trgm_ops does not exist" error:
- This is a database extension issue for text search
- Run the SQL from `docs/FIX_TRIGRAM_EXTENSION.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
- The fix will create fallback indexes if the trigram extension isn't available
- Refresh the page after running the fix

### If you see "Unexpected token '<'" error:
- This means the system is trying to call the real Edge Function
- Make sure `MOCK_MODE = true` in all hook files
- Refresh the page

### If any tab shows loading forever:
- Check the browser console for errors
- Make sure you've saved all hook files with mock mode enabled
- Try refreshing the page

### If actions don't work (invite/edit/remove/etc.):
- Check that mock mode is enabled in the relevant hook
- Look for any console errors
- Make sure you're clicking the correct buttons

### If customer details don't load:
- Check that `MOCK_MODE = true` in `useCustomerManager.ts`
- Verify the customer ID exists in the mock data
- Check browser console for errors

### If database migration fails:
- Check if you have the required tables (clients, user_roles, etc.)
- Run the schema fix files in order
- Contact support if you need help with database setup

### If you see "invalid input value for enum app_role: 'platform_admin'" error:
- This is a database enum issue where the role values don't match
- **Quick Fix**: Run the SQL from `docs/QUICK_FIX_DATA_EXPORT.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
- This script will:
  - Check current enum values
  - Add missing role values (zerion_admin, platform_admin)
  - Create/update audit_logs table and RLS policies
  - Verify the setup is working
- Refresh the page after running the fix
- Make sure you're testing in mock mode first (`MOCK_MODE = true` in `useDataExport.ts`)

## Production Deployment Checklist

## Troubleshooting

### Loyalty Management Issues

1. **"Cannot find loyalty settings"**
   - Verify mock data is properly loaded
   - Check client ID is correctly set
   - Ensure component is properly mounted

2. **Campaign creation fails**
   - Check all required fields are filled

   - Ensure at least one location is selected
   - Validate reward configuration for selected type

3. **Settings update not working**
   - Verify restaurant ID is available
   - Check form validation passes
   - Ensure all required fields have valid values

### General Mock Mode Issues

1. **"Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE'... is not valid JSON"**
   - This indicates Edge Functions are not deployed
   - Verify `MOCK_MODE = true` in the respective hook
   - Check network tab for actual response

2. **Components not loading**
   - Verify all imports are correct
   - Check console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure mock data arrays are properly defined

3. **Filters not working**
   - Check filter state management
   - Verify mock data includes varied statuses/types
   - Ensure filter logic handles empty/undefined values

4. **Toast notifications not appearing**
   - Verify `useToast` hook is properly imported
   - Check if toast provider is set up in app root
   - Ensure success/error messages are properly triggered

### Analytics Management Issues

1. **"column l.client_id does not exist" error**
   - This means the locations table is missing the client_id column
   - Run the SQL from `docs/FIX_ANALYTICS_SCHEMA.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
   - This will add the missing client_id, restaurant_id, and status columns to the locations table
   - Refresh the page after running the fix

2. **"invalid input syntax for type uuid" or "operator does not exist: uuid = character varying" error**
   - This indicates a type mismatch between UUID and VARCHAR columns
   - **Quick Fix**: Run the SQL from `docs/QUICK_FIX_ANALYTICS.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
   - This script will:
     - Check existing column types
     - Add missing columns with correct types
     - Safely update data without type conflicts
     - Create necessary indexes
   - Refresh the page after running the fix

3. **"No analytics data loading"**
   - Verify mock data is properly defined in useAnalyticsManager.ts
   - Check client ID is correctly set
   - Ensure component is properly mounted

4. **Filters not working**
   - Check filter state management in AnalyticsManager.tsx
   - Verify time range options are correctly handled
   - Ensure custom date range validation works

5. **Charts not displaying**
   - Verify trend data structure matches expected format
   - Check if data arrays are properly populated
   - Ensure chart components handle empty data gracefully

6. **Performance issues**
   - Check if multiple API calls are being made unnecessarily
   - Verify loading states are properly managed
   - Ensure data fetching is optimized

## Mock vs Production Differences

### Mock Mode Behavior
- âœ… Instant responses with simulated delays
- âœ… Predefined data sets for testing
- âœ… No actual database operations
- âœ… All CRUD operations work but don't persist
- âœ… Realistic error simulation
- âœ… Complete UI functionality testing

### Production Mode Behavior
- ðŸ”„ Real API calls to Supabase Edge Functions
- ðŸ”„ Actual database operations with RLS
- ðŸ”„ Real authentication and authorization
- ðŸ”„ Persistent data changes
- ðŸ”„ Network latency and potential failures
- ðŸ”„ Audit logging and compliance tracking

## Performance Notes

- Mock mode responses include realistic delays (600-1000ms)
- Production mode will have actual network latency
- Large datasets may require pagination optimization
- Consider implementing client-side caching for frequently accessed data

## Security Considerations

- Mock mode bypasses all authentication checks
- Production mode enforces RLS policies
- Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in mock responses
- Test role-based access control thoroughly in production

The mock mode provides a complete testing environment that mirrors the production functionality exactly across all management systems including the new analytics dashboard.
