# üîí RLS Security Analysis Report

## Current Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Assessment

### **Security Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è MIXED - Some Good, Some Concerning**

This analysis evaluates the current RLS policies against enterprise security standards and identifies areas for improvement.

---

## üö® Critical Security Issues Found

### **1. Overly Permissive System Policies**

**üî¥ HIGH RISK**: Several policies use `WITH CHECK (true)` which allows unrestricted access:

```sql
-- SECURITY ISSUE: No restrictions on platform activity logging
CREATE POLICY "System can insert platform activity" ON platform_activity_log
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (true);  -- ‚ùå DANGEROUS: Anyone can insert anything

-- SECURITY ISSUE: Unrestricted security event insertion  
CREATE POLICY "System can insert security events" ON security_events
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (true);  -- ‚ùå DANGEROUS: No validation of who can log events
```

**Risk**: Malicious users could:
- Flood audit logs with fake entries
- Hide real security events in noise
- Cause database bloat with spam entries

### **2. Staff Permission Granularity Issues**

**üü° MEDIUM RISK**: Staff policies rely on JSON permission checks that could be manipulated:

```sql
-- Potentially vulnerable to JSON manipulation
CREATE POLICY "Staff can add stamps for customers" ON stamps
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM location_staff ls
      WHERE ls.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND ls.location_id = stamps.location_id
      AND ls.status = 'active'
      AND (ls.permissions->>'can_add_stamps')::boolean = true  -- ‚ùå JSON-based security
    )
  );
```

**Risk**: If JSON permissions can be modified, unauthorized actions could occur.

### **3. Missing Row-Level Audit Controls**

**üü° MEDIUM RISK**: Some high-value operations lack sufficient audit trails:

```sql
-- Missing created_by tracking in some policies
CREATE POLICY "Location staff can manage location customers" ON customers
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    -- No audit of who created/modified customer records
  );
```

---

## ‚úÖ Security Strengths Identified

### **1. Proper Role-Based Access Control**
```sql
-- Good: Proper role hierarchy enforcement
CREATE POLICY "Client admins can manage their restaurants" ON restaurants
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles ur
      WHERE ur.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND ur.client_id = restaurants.client_id
      AND ur.role = 'client_admin'
      AND ur.status = 'active'  -- ‚úÖ Status check included
    )
  );
```

### **2. Multi-Level Permission Checks**
```sql
-- Good: Multiple validation layers
CREATE POLICY "Platform admins can manage all clients" ON platform_clients
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM platform_admin_users pau
      WHERE pau.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND pau.role IN ('platform_admin', 'super_admin')  -- ‚úÖ Role validation
      AND pau.status = 'active'                          -- ‚úÖ Status validation
    )
  );
```

### **3. Data Isolation**
```sql
-- Good: Proper tenant isolation
CREATE POLICY "Client admins can view own client" ON platform_clients
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles ur
      WHERE ur.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND ur.client_id = platform_clients.id  -- ‚úÖ Tenant isolation
      AND ur.role = 'client_admin'
      AND ur.status = 'active'
    )
  );
```

## üìä Security Compliance Matrix

| Security Principle | Status | Grade | Notes |
|-------------------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Least Privilege** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | C+ | Some policies too permissive |
| **Role-Based Access** | ‚úÖ Good | A- | Well-implemented hierarchy |

**Overall Security Grade: B-**

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Security Hardening

### **Priority 1: Fix System Policies (Critical)**

Replace overly permissive system policies:

```sql
-- REPLACE: Platform activity logging
DROP POLICY "System can insert platform activity" ON platform_activity_log;

CREATE POLICY "Service role can insert platform activity" ON platform_activity_log
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Only service role or authenticated users can log activity
    current_setting('role') = 'service_role' OR 
    (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND user_id = auth.uid())
  );

-- REPLACE: Security events logging  
DROP POLICY "System can insert security events" ON security_events;

CREATE POLICY "Controlled security event insertion" ON security_events
  FOR INSERT  
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Only service role for system events, or users for their own events
    current_setting('role') = 'service_role' OR
    (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND user_id = auth.uid())
  );
```

### **Priority 2: Harden Staff Permissions (High)**

Add additional validation for staff operations:

```sql
-- Enhanced staff validation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_staff_permission(
  user_id UUID, 
  location_id UUID, 
  permission_name TEXT
) RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM location_staff ls
    WHERE ls.user_id = user_id
    AND ls.location_id = location_id
    AND ls.status = 'active'
    AND (ls.permissions->>permission_name)::boolean = true
    -- Additional validation: check if permission is not expired
    AND (ls.permissions->>'permission_expires_at' IS NULL OR 
         (ls.permissions->>'permission_expires_at')::timestamp > NOW())
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### **Priority 3: Add Audit Requirements (Medium)**

Enhance audit capabilities:

```sql
-- Add audit triggers for sensitive operations
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION audit_sensitive_operation()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO security_events (user_id, event_type, description, metadata)
  VALUES (
    auth.uid(),
    TG_OP || '_' || TG_TABLE_NAME,
    'Sensitive operation on ' || TG_TABLE_NAME,
    jsonb_build_object(
      'table', TG_TABLE_NAME,
      'operation', TG_OP,
      'record_id', COALESCE(NEW.id, OLD.id),
      'timestamp', NOW()
    )
  );
  RETURN COALESCE(NEW, OLD);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Apply to sensitive tables
CREATE TRIGGER audit_customer_operations
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON customers
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_sensitive_operation();
```

## üîç Security Testing Recommendations

### **1. Permission Boundary Testing**
```sql
-- Test if users can access data outside their tenant
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers 
WHERE client_id != (
  SELECT client_id FROM user_roles 
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1
);
-- Should return 0 for non-admin users
```

### **2. Role Escalation Testing**
```sql
-- Test if staff can perform admin operations
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role, client_id) 
VALUES (auth.uid(), 'client_admin', 'some_client_id');
-- Should fail for non-admin users
```

### **3. System Policy Testing**
```sql
-- Test if regular users can spam system logs
INSERT INTO platform_activity_log (action, details) 
VALUES ('test_spam', '{}');
-- Should be controlled/restricted
```

## üö® Critical Security Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Fix the `WITH CHECK (true)` policies - these are critical security holes
2. **High Priority**: Add proper service role validation for system operations
3. **Medium Priority**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for all sensitive operations
4. **Ongoing**: Regular security policy reviews and penetration testing

**Current RLS Security Grade: B- (Good foundation, needs critical fixes)**

The RLS policies show a solid understanding of multi-tenant security but have some critical gaps that need immediate attention, particularly around system operations and audit controls.
