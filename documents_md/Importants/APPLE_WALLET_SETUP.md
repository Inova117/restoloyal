   - Click **+** to create new certificate
   - Select **Pass Type ID Certificate**
   - Choose your Pass Type ID
   - Upload Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
   - Download the certificate

2. **Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certificate**:
   - Download from [Apple's Certificate Authority](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/)
   - Install in your deployment environment

### Step 4: Certificate Installation

2. Store securely in Supabase Edge Function environment
3. Update the `generate-pkpass` function with proper signing

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Status

### ✅ Currently Implemented
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Complete Supabase Edge Functions
- **Pass Generation Logic**: JSON structure and data mapping
- **Frontend Integration**: Apple Wallet button with API calls
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and debugging
- **Database Schema**: Client and restaurant data structure

### 🔄 In Progress
- **Certificate Integration**: Waiting for Apple Developer setup
- **Pass Signing**: Will be implemented once certificates are available
- **ZIP File Generation**: Proper .pkpass file structure

### 📋 Next Steps
1. **Purchase Apple Developer Program** ($99)
2. **Register Pass Type ID** (`pass.com.zerionstudio.loyalty`)
3. **Generate and Download Certificates**
4. **Update Edge Function** with certificate signing
5. **Test with Real Devices**

## 🧪 Current Testing Status

### What Works Now
- ✅ Frontend button triggers backend function
- ✅ Authentication and authorization
- ✅ Database queries for client data
- ✅ Pass JSON structure generation
- ✅ File download mechanism
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

### What Needs Apple Certificates
- ❌ Proper .pkpass file signing
- ❌ Apple Wallet recognition
- ❌ Pass installation on devices
- ❌ Live pass updates

## 📱 Testing the Current Implementation

1. **Open the app** and navigate to client management
2. **Click "Add to Wallet"** on any client
3. **Check browser console** for detailed logs
4. **Verify file download** (will be unsigned JSON for now)
5. **Confirm error messages** are user-friendly

### Expected Behavior (Without Certificates)
- ✅ Button works and shows loading state
- ✅ Backend function executes successfully
- ✅ File downloads (but won't open in Apple Wallet)
- ✅ User-friendly message about Apple Developer requirement

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Certificate Management
- Store certificates securely in environment variables
- Use proper certificate rotation

### Pass Security
- Each pass has unique serial number
- Authentication tokens for updates
- Secure QR code generation

## 💡 Alternative Solutions (If Budget is a Concern)

### Temporary Workarounds
1. **QR Code Cards**: Generate downloadable QR code images
2. **Web-based Cards**: Progressive Web App with "Add to Home Screen"
3. **SMS/Email Cards**: Send digital cards via messaging

### Future Enhancements
1. **Google Pay Integration**: Android wallet support
2. **Samsung Pay**: Additional Android coverage
3. **Custom Wallet App**: Build your own wallet solution
